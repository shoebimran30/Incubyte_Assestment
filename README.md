## String Calculator TDD Kata   
### Description    

String Calculator is a simple Ruby on Rails application that implements a basic string calculator following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. The calculator provides a method add that takes a string of comma-separated numbers as input and returns the sum of those numbers.

### Features
- Handles empty strings, single numbers, and multiple numbers separated by commas.
- Allows newline characters between numbers instead of commas.
- Supports different delimiters specified at the beginning of the string.
- Throws an exception for negative numbers and displays all negative numbers in the exception message.
